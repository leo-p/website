This book is to the women reproductive system what Giulia Enders's book [Gut](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23013953-gut) was to our digestive system.

It goes through everything, point by point, in an effort to educate and cast away the myth from the reality. Anatomy, periods, sex, contraception, abortion and even known issues, everything goes.

As such it's a must read, whether you're a man or a woman!
