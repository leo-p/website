After his book [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things), Ben Horowitz from the famous VC firm Andreessen Horowitz is back at it with one of his favourite subject: company culture.

This time he goes through three historical leaders, how they defined their culture, managed it day to day and ultimately how this can apply to your business culture.

You'll learn about:

- **Toussaint Louverture**, a slave who led the first successfull slave revolution and formed Haiti.
- **Shaka Senghor**, a former convict who made his way as the leader of a jail squad and then reformed its violent culture from the inside-out.
- **Genghis Khan**, the famous conqueror who also was the greatest at assimilating and redefining social bonds.

The historical parts of this book are enough to make it a satisfying read, couple it with great and actionable advice and it becomes a must-read.
