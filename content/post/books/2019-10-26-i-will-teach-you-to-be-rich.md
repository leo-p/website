On the second edition of the book, Ramit goes over everything that makes up your personal finance.
This book is cleary aimed for the american crowd, with a large chunk of it dediacted to credit card debt management and psychology. This is the section that least interested me.

On the other hand, what I particularly love is that this book explains the promise and pitfalls of a lot of US financial products: credit card, checking account, saving account, 401K, Roth IRA. All those products are clearly reviewed with their pros and cons and what to do about it.

A must read for any non-american settling down in the US.
