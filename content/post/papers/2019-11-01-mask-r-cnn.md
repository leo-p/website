- **Mask R-CNN**<br/>
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | [ICCV 2017](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/He_Mask_R-CNN_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)

Mask R-CNN is a new kind of instance segmentation network which builds on top of Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN is composed of a class label and bounding-box offset branch for each candidate object. Thus Mask R-CNN adds a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition.

This new branch outputs a binary mask for each object direcly at the pixel size and all feature maps need to be aligned.

They introduce RoIAlign, an improvement on RoiPool which improve quantization and properly align the extracted features with the input: no more quantization roudning but exact value coupled with bilinear interpolation to compute the features and agregate the result.

**Summary:**

- Improve Faster R-CNN for instance segmentation.
- Introduce RoIAlign.
