[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02739)

This new paper generates consistent and high-fidelity 3D shapes from 2D images. This is a large improvement on previous methods that used iterative shape deformation.

They proceed as follow:

1. Use a usual R-CNN to produce a bounding box and 2D mask.
2. Implement a new branch to cubify the image.
3. Generate a cubed mesh.
4. Align mesh with image.
5. Refine voxel to mesh several times.
6. Go through steps 4 and 5 several times.

They also impose a regularisation on the distance between consecutive vertices. This decreases performance a little but leads to better and smoother overall shapes.

**Summary:**

- Transform 2D image into 3D mesh
- Cubify object as intermediary step
- Generate smooth object with possible holes (donut style)
