- ️️️**SinGAN, Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image**<br/>

SinGAN, short for Single GAN, is a GAN trained on *a single image*. It's then used to generate sample from the same image.

The same model can then be used to perform a lot of transformations including:

- image inpainting
- image editing
- image harmonization
- super-resolution
- video animation from one frame

To train the model they use a multi-stage patch discriminator. Each generator is given an upsampled version of the previous generator image plus a random noise. The discriminators then evaluate patches from the real and fake image.

**Summary:**

- Train on one single image
- Use multi-stage patch for discrimination
- Reuse model for several applications
