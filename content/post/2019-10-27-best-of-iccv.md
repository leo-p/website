# International Conference on Computer Vision

[ICCV 2019](http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/) is one of the two foremost conferences on Computer Vision/Deep Learning. They are a lot of sessions and paper presentation including:

- Tutorials: grand lectures with broad topic and low requirements.
- Workshops: latest paper and work to be published grouped by suject.

All papers can be found on the [Computer Vision Fondation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/ICCV2019.py) website.

# Day 1 - Interpretability

## Interpretable Machine Learning for Computer Vision ([tutorial](https://interpretablevision.github.io)):

- **Understanding Deep Networks via Extremal Perturbations and Smooth Masks**, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08485)

Very interesting occlusion technique to find the best 10% of an image that best explain the classification score.

- **Towards best practice in explaining neural network decisions with LRP**, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09840)

Use Layer-wise Relevance Propagation to explain which part of an image matter to the classification task. Contrary to the previous technique, this implies diving inside the actual network.

# Day 2 - Recognition

## Visual Recognition for Images, Video, and 3D ([tutorial](https://alexander-kirillov.github.io/tutorials/visual-recognition-iccv19/)):

- **Mesh R-CNN**, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02739)

Evolution of Mask R-CNN but for 3D shapes.

- **Detectron2**, [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

Facebook detection model zoo for PyTorch.

- **Deformable convolution**, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06211)

Old paper, at least not from this year, but deemed very worthwhile. Might be worth a second look.
